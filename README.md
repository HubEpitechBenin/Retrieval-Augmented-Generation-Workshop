# Intro-AI-ChatBot
During this workshop, students had the opportunity to create an intelligent chatbot capable of answering questions from a specific data source.  Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation, they learned how to combine language models (LLM) such as Chat GPT with data retrieval from documents to build a concrete Artificial Intelligence application.
